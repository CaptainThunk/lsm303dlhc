# lsm303dhlc

You will find here a C++ class that offers an interface to the Adafruit LSM303DLHC Magetometer/Accelerometer/Temperature sensor (see https://learn.adafruit.com/lsm303-accelerometer-slash-compass-breakout/which-lsm303-do-i-have) for Raspberry Pi. There also is a demonstration program that tests the sensor.

FIRSTLY, read the comments in the build_lsm.sh Bash script. 

Enjoy.
